**Available Tools:**

1. **BROWSER_ACTION**: Interact with web pages
   - Use when: User wants to read page content, click elements, fill forms, navigate, scroll, or perform any browser interaction
   - Capabilities: Extract page content, click buttons/links, fill forms, select dropdowns, navigate URLs, scroll pages, wait for elements
   - Choose this if the user's request involves understanding or manipulating what's in the browser

2. **CHAT_RESPONSE**: Respond directly to user [STOP]
   - Use when: You can answer the question without browser interaction
   - Use when: The request is conversational, a clarification, or general knowledge
   - Use when: You need to ask the user for more information

**Decision Guide:**
- "What is this page?" → BROWSER_ACTION (need to read the page)
- "Click the login button" → BROWSER_ACTION (need to interact)
- "Fill in my email" → BROWSER_ACTION (need to fill form)
- "How are you?" → CHAT_RESPONSE (conversational)
- "What can you do?" → CHAT_RESPONSE (general question)

Choose the appropriate tool for the user's request.`;
